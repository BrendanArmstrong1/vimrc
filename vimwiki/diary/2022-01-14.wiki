Today is the 14th of January.

I think I have a good amount of work done on my productivity setup. I still want too 
push it even further though. I would like to get a news app set up to work with my 
system, probably something like newsboat, but I would like it too be in vim. I will
have to see what I can get.

Oh, I also need to get a solid todo list setup. I'm hoping that I can use calendar vim
to make this happen.
