This is what I want from emacs:

    * [ ] vimwiki like notetaking
        * [ ] cross-linking notes
        * [ ] categorical awareness
    * [ ] terminal split code execution
    * [o] comprehensive file management
        * [X] fuzzy finding
        * [ ] ripgrep
    * [ ] calendar with sync to google calendar
    * [ ] code snippets
    * [ ] quick split navigation
    * [ ] vim like control
        * [ ] indents-as-objects
        * [ ] surround
        * [ ] repeat
        * [ ] sneak
        * [ ] yank-highlighting
        * [ ] bracketed paste
    * [X] sonokai color-scheme

I will start with doom emacs and see how to modify it's properties.

I have given up on my attempt to get emacs working. I simply like vim
too much. Perhaps I will give it another try later in life.
