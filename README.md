# This is my vimrc

This is my vimrc. It is here so that I can have easy access to my configurations from anywhere. Anyone is free to use my configs
at their own discretion.

I don't use a completion engine like CoC or youcompleteme. Instead I use vim's native completion and fill in the blanks with
snippets.

I have a few important plugins that I really enjoy. fzf is amazing for navigating a file system and also works well with ripgrep.

Vim surround, repeat, sneak, and indent object are essential pieces of vim that I cannot live without. Also I use the sonokai
color scheme because my programming journey began with sublime and I really like that palette.
